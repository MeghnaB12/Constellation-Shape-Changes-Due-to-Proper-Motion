# Effect of the proper motion on the shapes of constellations with time

The project aims to study the effect of proper motion on the shapes of constellations over time. Proper motion refers to the apparent motion of stars across the celestial sphere due to their actual motion and the Earth's position and motion. It explores the various factors affecting proper motion, such as parallax, distance from the galactic center, influence of gravity, and more. The project uses data from the GAIA and HIPPARCOS space missions, which provide accurate measurements of the positions, proper motion, and other properties of stars. The data is analyzed using Python and libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Basemap, Skyfield, and Astropy. To simulate the change in shape of constellations, the Azimuthal Equidistant map projection is used to convert the celestial sphere into a 2D surface. The RA and DEC values of stars are calculated for different years using their proper motion, and the stars are plotted in the Azimuthal Equidistant projection. Multiple images are created to show the change in shape of constellations over a period of 200,000 years. This project provides insights into the motion of stars and how it affects the appearance of constellations. It contributes to our understanding of the dynamics of the celestial sphere and the factors influencing the shapes of constellations.
